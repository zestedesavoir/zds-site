Apache Solr Content Extraction Library (Solr Cell)
                            Release Notes

This file describes changes to the Solr Cell (contrib/extraction) module.  See SOLR-284 for details.

Introduction
------------

Apache Solr Extraction provides a means for extracting and indexing content contained in "rich" documents, such
as Microsoft Word, Adobe PDF, etc.  (Each name is a trademark of their respective owners)  This contrib module
uses Apache Tika to extract content and metadata from the files, which can then be indexed.  For more information,
see http://wiki.apache.org/solr/ExtractingRequestHandler

Getting Started
---------------
You will need Solr up and running.  Then, simply add the extraction JAR file, plus the Tika dependencies (in the ./lib folder)
to your Solr Home lib directory.  See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/ExtractingRequestHandler for more details on hooking it in
 and configuring.
