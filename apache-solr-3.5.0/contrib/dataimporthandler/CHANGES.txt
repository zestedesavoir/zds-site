Build
----------------------


Documentation
----------------------

================== Release 1.4.0 ==================

Upgrading from Solr 1.3
-----------------------

Evaluator API has been changed in a non back-compatible way. Users who have developed custom Evaluators will need
to change their code according to the new API for it to work. See SOLR-996 for details.

The formatDate evaluator's syntax has been changed. The new syntax is formatDate(<variable>, '<format_string>').
For example, formatDate(x.date, 'yyyy-MM-dd'). In the old syntax, the date string was written without a single-quotes.
The old syntax has been deprecated and will be removed in 1.5, until then, using the old syntax will log a warning.

The Context API has been changed in a non back-compatible way. In particular, the Context.currentProcess() method
now returns a String describing the type of the current import process instead of an int. Similarily, the public
constants in Context viz. FULL_DUMP, DELTA_DUMP and FIND_DELTA are changed to a String type. See SOLR-969 for details.

The EntityProcessor API has been simplified by moving logic for applying transformers and handling multi-row outputs
from Transformers into an EntityProcessorWrapper class. The EntityProcessor#destroy is now called once per
parent-row at the end of row (end of data). A new method EntityProcessor#close is added which is called at the end
of import.

In Solr 1.3, if the last_index_time was not available (first import) and a delta-import was requested, a full-import
was run instead. This is no longer the case. In Solr 1.4 delta import is run with last_index_time as the epoch
date (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT) if last_index_time is not available.

Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------
1. SOLR-768:  Set last_index_time variable in full-import command.
              (Wojtek Piaseczny, Noble Paul via shalin)

2. SOLR-811:  Allow a "deltaImportQuery" attribute in SqlEntityProcessor which is used for delta imports
              instead of DataImportHandler manipulating the SQL itself.
              (Noble Paul via shalin)

3. SOLR-842:  Better error handling in DataImportHandler with options to abort, skip and continue imports.
              (Noble Paul, shalin)

4. SOLR-833:  A DataSource to read data from a field as a reader. This can be used, for example, to read XMLs
              residing as CLOBs or BLOBs in databases.
              (Noble Paul via shalin)

5. SOLR-887:  A Transformer to strip HTML tags.

              (Jon Baer, Noble Paul via shalin)

              of TemplateTransformer in other transformers, among other things.
              (Fergus McMenemie, Noble Paul via shalin)

20.SOLR-1066: New methods in Context to expose Script details. ScriptTransformer changed to read scripts
              through the new API methods.
              (Noble Paul via shalin)

              (Jon Baer, Noble Paul via shalin)

22.SOLR-1065: A ContentStreamDataSource which can accept HTTP POST data in a content stream. This can be used to

              (Noble Paul via shalin)

23.SOLR-1061: Improve RegexTransformer to create multiple columns from regex groups.
              (Noble Paul via shalin)

24.SOLR-1059: Special flags introduced for deleting documents by query or id, skipping rows and stopping further
              transforms. Use $deleteDocById, $deleteDocByQuery for deleting by id and query respectively.
              Use $skipRow to skip the current row but continue with the document. Use $stopTransform to stop
              further transformers. New methods are introduced in Context for deleting by id and query.
              (Noble Paul, Fergus McMenemie, shalin)

25.SOLR-1076: JdbcDataSource should resolve variables in all its configuration parameters.
              (shalin)

26.SOLR-1055: Make DIH JdbcDataSource easily extensible by making the createConnectionFactory method protected and
              return a Callable<Connection> object.
              (Noble Paul, shalin)

27.SOLR-1058: JdbcDataSource can lookup javax.sql.DataSource using JNDI. Use a jndiName attribute to specify the
              location of the data source.
              (Jason Shepherd, Noble Paul via shalin)

28.SOLR-1083: An Evaluator for escaping query characters.

29.SOLR-934:  A MailEntityProcessor to enable indexing mails from POP/IMAP sources into a solr index.
              (Preetam Rao, shalin)

30.SOLR-1060: A LineEntityProcessor which can stream lines of text from a given file to be indexed directly or
              for processing with transformers and child entities.
              (Fergus McMenemie, Noble Paul, shalin)

31.SOLR-1127: Add support for field name to be templatized.
              (Noble Paul, shalin)

32.SOLR-1092: Added a new command named 'import' which does not automatically clean the index. This is useful and
              more appropriate when one needs to import only some of the entities.
              (Noble Paul via shalin)
              
33.SOLR-1153: 'deltaImportQuery' is honored on child entities as well (noble) 

34.SOLR-1230: Enhanced dataimport.jsp to work with all DataImportHandler request handler configurations,
              rather than just a hardcoded /dataimport handler. (ehatcher)
              
35.SOLR-1235: disallow period (.) in entity names (noble)

36.SOLR-1234: Multiple DIH does not work because all of them write to dataimport.properties.
              Use the handler name as the properties file name (noble)

37.SOLR-1348: Support binary field type in convertType logic in JdbcDataSource (shalin)

38.SOLR-1406: Make FileDataSource and FileListEntityProcessor to be more extensible (Luke Forehand, shalin)

39.SOLR-1437 : XPathEntityProcessor can deal with xpath syntaxes such as //tagname , /root//tagname (Fergus McMenemie via noble)

              (Ricky Leung, Noble Paul via shalin)

2. SOLR-974:  DataImportHandler skips commit if no data has been updated.

1. SOLR-782:  Refactored SolrWriter to make it a concrete class and removed wrappers over SolrInputDocument.
              Refactored to load Evaluators lazily. Removed multiple document nodes in the configuration xml.
              Removed support for 'default' variables, they are automatically available as request parameters.

================== Release 1.3.0 ==================

Status
------
This is the first release since DataImportHandler was added to the contrib solr distribution.
The following changes list changes since the code was introduced, not since
the first official release.


Detailed Change List
--------------------

New Features
1. SOLR-700:  Allow configurable locales through a locale attribute in fields for NumberFormatTransformer.
              (Stefan Oestreicher, shalin)

Changes in runtime behavior

Bug Fixes
1. SOLR-704:  NumberFormatTransformer can silently ignore part of the string while parsing. Now it tries to
              use the complete string for parsing. Failure to do so will result in an exception.
              (Stefan Oestreicher via shalin)

2. SOLR-729:  Context.getDataSource(String) gives current entity's DataSource instance regardless of argument.
              (Noble Paul, shalin)

3. SOLR-726:  Jdbc Drivers and DataSources fail to load if placed in multicore sharedLib or core's lib directory.
