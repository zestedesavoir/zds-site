A powerful, yet easy to implement thumbnailing application for Django 1.4+

Below is a quick summary of usage. For more comprehensive information, view the
`full documentation`__ online or the peruse the project's ``docs`` directory.

__ http://easy-thumbnails.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html


Installation
============

Run ``pip install easy-thumbnails``.

Add ``easy_thumbnails`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'easy_thumbnails',
    )

If you have South installed then run ``manage.py migrate easy_thumbnails``,
otherwise just run ``manage.py syncdb``.


Example usage
=============

Thumbnail options can be predefined in ``settings.THUMBNAIL_ALIASES`` or just
specified in the template or Python code when run.

Using a predefined alias
------------------------

Given the following setting::

    THUMBNAIL_ALIASES = {
        '': {
            'avatar': {'size': (50, 50), 'crop': True},
        },
    }

Template::

    {% load thumbnail %}
    <img src="{{ profile.photo|thumbnail_url:'avatar' }}" alt="" />

Python::

    from easy_thumbnails.files import get_thumbnailer
    thumb_url = get_thumbnailer(profile.photo)['avatar'].url

Manually specifying size / options
----------------------------------

Template::

    {% load thumbnail %}
    <img src="{% thumbnail profile.photo 50x50 crop %}" alt="" />

Python::

    from easy_thumbnails.files import get_thumbnailer
    options = {'size': (100, 100), 'crop': True}
    thumb_url = get_thumbnailer(profile.photo).get_thumbnail(options).url


Fields
======

You can use ``ThumbnailerImageField`` (or ``ThumbnailerFileField``) for easier
access to retrieve or generate thumbnail images.

For example::

    from easy_thumbnails.fields import ThumbnailerImageField

    class Profile(models.Model):
        user = models.OneToOneField('auth.User')
        photo = ThumbnailerImageField(upload_to='photos', blank=True)

Accessing the field's predefined alias in a template::

    {% load thumbnail %}
    <img src="{{ profile.photo.avatar.url }}" alt="" />

Accessing the field's predefined alias in Python code::

    thumb_url = profile.photo['avatar'].url


Thumbnail options
=================

``crop``
--------

Before scaling the image down to fit within the ``size`` bounds, it first cuts
the edges of the image to match the requested aspect ratio.

Use ``crop="smart"`` to try to keep the most interesting part of the image,

Use ``crop="0,10"`` to crop from the left edge and a 10% offset from the
top edge. Crop from a single edge by leaving dimension empty (e.g.
``crop=",0"``). Offset from the right / bottom by using negative numbers
(e.g., crop="-0,-10").

Often used with the ``upscale`` option, which will allow enlarging of the image
during scaling.

``quality=XX``
--------------

Changes the quality of the output JPEG thumbnail. Defaults to ``85``.

In Python code, this is given as a separate option to the ``get_thumbnail``
method rather than just alter the other

Other options
-------------

Valid thumbnail options are determined by the "thumbnail processors" installed.

See the `reference documentation`__ for a complete list of options provided by
the default thumbnail processors.

Changes
=======

2.3 (release pending)
---------------------

* New ``Alias`` namer.

* Avoid a potential concurrency issue with creating the cache.

* Fix incorrect use of select_related for source thumbnail model.

* Removed some vestigal processor arguments.

* Allow ``HIGH_RESOLUTION`` argument on thumbnail template tag.

* Add logic to correctly handle thumbnail images on deferred models (e.g. when
  using ``.only()``).

* Add a ``data_uri`` filter to allow rendering of an image inline as a data
  uri.

2.2.1 (2014-12-30)
------------------

* Fixed: Option ``zoom`` can also be used by itself, without combining it with
  ``crop``.

2.2 (2014-10-04)
----------------

* Fix migrations for Django 1.7 final.

* Fix contain bad image EXIFs being able to still raise an exception.

2.1 (2014-08-13)
----------------

* Fix Python 3.4 installation issue.

* Avoid an OverflowError due to invalid EXIF data.

* Fix bug causing JPEG images to be saved without optimization :(

* JPEG files can now be saved with progressive encoding. By default, any image
  with a dimension larger than 100px will be saved progressively. Configured
  with the ``THUMBNAILER_PROGRESSIVE`` setting.

2.0.1 (2014-04-26)
------------------

* Fix packaging issue with old south migrations.

2.0 (2014-04-25)
----------------

* Use Django 1.7 migrations. Thanks Trey Hunner.
  **Note**: if using South, read the installation docs for required settings
  changes.

* Make ThumbnailerImageField.resize_source reflect change in extension.

* Add ``target`` option to the scale_and_crop processor, allowing for image
  focal points when cropping (or zooming) an image.

* Add a THUMBNAIL_NAMER option which takes a function used to customize
  the thumbnail filename.

* New ``subsampling`` option to reduce color subsampling of JPEG images,
  providing sharper color borders for a small increase in file size.

* Reimplementation of the ``thumbnail_cleanup`` command. Thanks JÃ¸rgen
  Abrahamsen

* More efficient thumbnail default storage. Thanks Sandip Agarwal.

1.5 (2014-03-05)
----------------

* Better support for multiple source generators.

* Update method used to check for modification dates of source and thumbnail
  images. Thanks Ben Roberts.

* Better thumbnail_high_resolution handling, including the ability to switch on
  and off explicitly with a ``HIGH_RESOLUTION`` thumbnail option.

* Added configuration option to specify the infix used for high resolution
  image handling.

* Optional postprocessor for image optimization. Thanks Jacob Rief!

* More remote storages optimization

* Thumbnail dimensions can now optionally be cached. Thanks David Novakovic.

* New ``zoom`` option to generate a thumbnail of a source image with a
  percentage clipped off each side.

* New ``background`` source processor that can add a border color to ensure
  scaled images fit within the exact dimensions given.

1.4 (2013-09-23)
----------------

* Considerable speed up for remote storages by reducing queries.
  Brent O'Connor spent a lot of time debugging this, so thank you epicserve!

* Allow the ``{% thumbnail %}`` tag to also accept aliases. Thanks Simon Meers!

* Fixed a problem with the ``ImageClearableFileInput`` widget.

1.1 (2012-08-29)

* Added a way to avoid generating thumbnails if they don't exist already (with
  a signal to deal with them elsewhere).

* Added a ``thumbnailer_passive`` filter to allow templates to use the
